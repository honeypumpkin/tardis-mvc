<!--HTML: Hypertext Markup Language

used on web
uses a browser (renders the html) to view

CSS: Cascading style sheets

controls the visual appearance of every webpage -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Doctype determines "which version of html" is being used (5, 4 etc) to render the page -->

<html>

<!-- notice all tags are paired -->
<!-- all elements will be nested inside these html tags -->

  <head>
    <!-- the head is for "meta" info -->
    <title>My Page</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- meta tags, css page links, font links, frameworks for the page -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- any content that needs to be viewed needs to be in the body tags -->
    <ul>
      <li>one</li>
      <li>two</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    a paragraph goes here</p>
    <h1>heres a head</h1>

    <!-- REMEMBER THE HTML SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW THE PAGE LOOKS
    CSS will do this for us. HTML should dictate content only
    reasons:
    1. seperation of concerns
    2. pages not always read by humans

    We should practice SEMANTIC HTML, or meaning, vs. syntax.
    Our html should describe what it is making.
